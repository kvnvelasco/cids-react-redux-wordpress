# A wordpress theme in react??

So, in 2015 I decided to take a stab and making a wordpress theme in react. The idea was to have the js files served statically by the wordpress server and then use the wordpress rest api plugin to fetch data. 

React + redux.

To start the project, install the latest docker you can get your hands on and 
`docker-compose up`
